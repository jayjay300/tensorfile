Section 4: About this FAQ/Walkthrough ( 4aleg )

Q) Why did you decide to write a FAQ/Walkthrough for this game?
A) Good question! I decided to write an FAQ/Walkthrough for this game for
many reasons. Firstly, this was the first movie I ever went to a theatre
and saw as a child; I remember it VERY vividly, even to this day. Secondly,
I just bought this game yesterday (As of 1-22-2012), and when I searched it
on GameFAQs, I found it had very low scores in the review section, and, to my
surprise, NO FAQ or walkthrough! I knew something had to be done, and I knew
I had to be the one to do it. Thirdly, this game is actually pretty hard,
and if you don't know the Rugrats as well as me (I grew up watching them),
or haven't seen this movie, you might have a little trouble with this game.

Q) How long do you expect it to take to finish this FAQ/Walkthrough (as of
1-22-2012)?
A) Another great question! I expect it to take me no more than a year or so.
So, it'll probably be finished a while before 2013, if there are no hold-ups
or delays in the process...

Q) By which means are you playing this game?
A) I'm playing the GBC-enhanced version of this game (the GB-shaped,
black-colored GBC cart) on a GBA-SP. Having said that, this FAQ/Walkthrough
also applies to the non-GBC-enhanced version of the game, kind of like
how a walkthrough for TLoZ: Link's Awakening would also work on TLoZ:
Link's Awakening DX.

===============================================================================

Section 5: Walkthrough ( 5arug )

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Level One ( ruglv1 )

You'll begin the level in the Pickles' basement, where Stu makes his toys and
inventions. You'll be controlling Stu Pickles' son, Tommy Pickles. Jump off
of the swivel-chair and walk to your right to find your first item- jump up to
grab it. In certain levels, you are required to have a certain amount of items
to complete the level; however, in this level, you can see the amount says that
"00" items are needed. Just grab items for your score's sake (Not that the game
even saves your score[s])...

Watch out for the electric waves on the power generator- if you touch them,
you'll get hurt, and items will fly away from you (Like when Sonic the
Hedgehog gets hit and looses rings). Continue to your right, and immediately
after passing the cardboard box reading "Junk", you will find three items
near the large machine. Continue to your right to find another item near
the leftmost side of the table and the spider webs. Then, jump up
onto that table, and jump onto the switch on the right side of the machine.
I still haven't figured out what it does, but it is necessary to complete the
level, to my knowledge.

Walk to your right, all the way past the machines and power generator. After
you walk past the swivel-chair, there will be another table. Breifly press
the B (Jump) button to get these two items near the edge of the table top,
so that you don't jump onto the table itself. Continue to your right past
another swivel-chair. The next table will have another item on it's edge.
Continue to your right until you reach the stairs with the golden word
"Goal" next to them. Congratulations,  you've beat the first level!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Level Two ( ruglv2 )

Now, you will be in the Pickles' living room. Walk under the bouncing
ball to avoid being hit, then jump over the scenery blocks (Not to be
mistaken for collectible, golden item blocks), and also jump over the robot.
The robot is an "enemy", so make sure that you don't touch it, because if
you do, Tommy will loose his items! Jump onto the chair that Grandpa
Pickles is usually sleeping in (On the cartoon, anyways), then onto the
top of the TV to collect another item. To the right of the TV, on the floor,
will be yet ANOTHER item! Continue to your right, and hop onto the blocks.
Allow me to explain the game's balloons BEFORE you jump onto them.

This game has balloons you can jump onto to find more items, and explore
more areas. Be aware that if you fall from a high place in this game,
you WILL lose all of your items, and I mean, ALL of them. To jump really
high on the balloons, you have to time your jumps perfectly with touching
the balloon you're standing on. It takes a bit of practice to learn, but,
it's not the hardest thing ever. It kind of reminds me of the balloons
in Cool Spot on SNES and Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.

Watch out for the "enemy" toy [air]planes that could hit you while you
jump on the balloons. Jump onto the ceiling light above the picture of
Tommy's mom, Didi Pickles, to find another item on it's rightmost side.
Jump all the way to the left side of the chain of balloons to find another
item on another ceiling light. Continue back to the right on the chain
of balloons, passing the other ceiling light, to find one more ceiling 
light, with another item on it's rightmost side. Decend the balloons and 
land on the blocks that got you up there in the first place, then, 
continue right on theground.

Once you've landed, go to the right to find another item near the column in
the wall. Continue right, then jump onto the blocks, the chair, and the 
bookcase, to get onto the fireplace, which has 2 items. Drop off of the
bookshelf with the candles, then go to your left, to find one more item.
Keep going right to find another item. You can also jump onto balloons here,
however, I still haven't figured out how to get up there; if you have,
hit me up on my GameFAQs message box, and tell me!

Jump up and get the item on the bookshelf to your right, then continue
right, and jump over the blocks and the robot. If you keep going right,
you'll find the back door, and a robot. Hop over the robot, then go to
the words "Goal" to your right to beat the level.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Level Three ( ruglv3 )

There will be an item immediately above you; jump up to get it. In this
level, you'll need to collect 14 items to win! Remember, if you get hit, you
lose ALL of your items. Beware!

Go to your right to find the sandbox. Watch out for the bird, and time
your jump on the green and yellow ball to get the item above it and to it's
left. The ball acts as a small balloon. Get the other item near the peak of
the sand mountain, too. Proceed to your right, and jump over the spider. There
will be an item above Spike's (The Pickles' dog) doghouse. Go right and jump
the neighbor's fence. Jump onto the balloons and collect the two items
slightly to the right of the beginning of the chain of balloons. Then, jump
on the balloons to your left, and collect more items.

Go back down to the ground by decending the balloons and landing on the
neighbor's fence. Go to your right, and jump over the mole holes to get
an item. The mole will jump out sometimes and hit you if you're not
careful. Near a distant electricity pole, there will be another item. Keep
heading right, to find two more items near two mole holes and a bird. Jump
over the neighbor's fence to your right. You can climb onto the balloons to
get more items, or just continue right. Since we got two (or more) on the
balloons before, we won't need to get any more in the sky- the ground has the
rest of the items we need. Get the item over the neighbor's dog house, and
under their window. Go past near the unoperational fountain, then jump to
snag the item above it. Continue to your right, past the word "Goal" (If
you got more items in the sky that were optional, you will go to the next
level if you walk past the goal). Hop the neighbor's fence to get one more
item at the very edge of their yard. Cautiously walk back to the goal, and
be transported to the next level.

PASSWORD: RQVDHJVV (in lowercase, that's r q v d h j v v )


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Level Four ( ruglv4 )

You'll see a scene of the Rugrats walking after your get your score. Now
you're driving the Reptar car Tommy's dad made! Collect the items in front
of you, and DON'T HIT ANY SCENERY, or you will have to start the level all
over again! You can press the B button to speed the car up a little bit,
however, I don't suggest going fast, because you might hit something
unexpected, and have to restart the level all over again. The level will
be fairly straightforward until you get to the traffic cones.

Keep to the right of the traffic cones, then collect the items to their right.
Stay straight- do not turn to your left or right at the intersection. Make
sure not to hit the roadblocks! Keep going foward. There will be a circle
of traffic cones around a pothole that has no cover. DO NOT drive into the
pothole! Keep going straight, and don't go out of your way to get far-away
items. You'll reach the goal in a few seconds, then get another cutscene.

PASSWORD: TQMMY QK (in lowercase, thats' t q m m y (SPACE) q k )


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Level Five ( ruglv5 )

You're now at the hospital to find Tommy's newborn brother, Dil. Press right
to scroll through the characters to explore a corridor, and see if Dil is
there. If you're wondering, that's Dr. Lipschitz on the TV next to Lil; he's
a child psychiatrist that Didi depends a LOT on to raise Tommy.

Hi. The name iz Zackman. I played Rugrats: Search for Reptar™ and
found it rather entertaining. There are some tough spots in the game
which i will point out.  Here goes...

2: THE GAME/STORY
---------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, this game is pointed to the younger audience, from 4 to 8. Or
anyone who likes Rugrats... It's really short, but once you explore
everything, it gets kinda okay.

The story? Tommy plays around in the living room while the babies watch
Reptar on TV. Tommy makes a pretty good impression of Reptar himself,
knocking over blocks and kicking over a toy car. ''Where's my Reptar
puzzle?'' He looks to the Reptar doll. ''There it is!'' He picks it up.
Chuckie asks, ''W-where are the pieces?'' Tommy replies, ''They're
inside!'' He shakes the doll and one puzzle piece falls out. He starts
to cry. Stu and Didi enter the room. ''Whoa... Either all the pieces are
missing, or that's the world's easiest puzzle.'' Stu chuckles. ''Oh
my... the pieces must be all over the house!'' Didi says. Stu thinks,
then hands Tommy a ball. ''Here, champ... have a ball!'' They leave the
room. Tommy throws the ball away, and picks up the puzzle piece. He
looks up in the sky and says, ''We'll find every piece of you Reptar,
even if we hafta search the whole world!!' Thus beginning the search for
Reptar...

---------------------------------------------------------------
3: WHY RUGRATS, ZACKMAN?!
---------------------------------------------------------------

Why Rugrats? Too much Cocacola... Litterally. Basically, i'm a little
too asleep to realize what i'm doing.. by the time i send this, i'll be
thinking... ''What the bleep did i just do?!?'' Ah well. Besides, i had
to help alot of my friends with this, especially the hard levels.  So I
give my help to all of you. yeah whuteva..

4: WALKTHROUGH
---------------------------------------------------------------

Chuckie Loses his Glasses [Easy]

 Rain.. nuts! Nothing to do. What do we play? How about Pin the Tail on
Chuckie? or Hide and go Peek!  but Chuckie's it, and extra eyes aren't
fair. He searches for his friends and Angelica without his glasses.
 Most of the time, the babies are on the 2nd floor of the house. But
they're also sometimes at the bottom. If they are upstairs, run to the
stairs and jump clear across them. Go straight through the kitchen and
to the playpen. Done! Hit /_\ to tag a baby, then run.

Ice Cream Mountain [Easy]

Stu wants to go golfing. He takes the kids and promises them a huge ice
cream mountain! Yum...
 To put simply, walk to the ball and your golf club will appear. Hold
down [_] to aim your club better and you should have no problem. At the
bottom of this walkthrough is the descriptive version of this level.

---------------------------------------------------------------
5: SECRETS
---------------------------------------------------------------

Jump over stairs!!
 
 While running when you are upstairs, go to the stairs and jump you
should jump straight over them without hurting yourself.

Incident on Aisle 7 Shortcut!

 Near the beginning with the plants, you should find some balloons. Go
towards them and grab them. You'll float to where the grocers try to get
you.

I would like to thank my grandson, Kory, who is an experienced and advanced
game player,
for playing the game on Reptar Tough when I came to challenges I couldn’t get
through
myself.  With his help, I was able to get information I needed to complete this
walkthrough.

1. STORYLINE AND BASIC INSTRUCTIONS

Stu Pickles has invented a fantastic multi-level play set for children, the
Play Palace 3000. He
sets it up in his back yard for the babies to try out. Angelica steals the
babies' favorite toys
and holds them for ransom in the highest level of the castle on top of the play
set. The babies
complete the game challenges to get to the top of the play set and get their
toys back from
Angelica.

ANGELICA is heard in the background whenever you are in the central area of the
play set and
when you are on the ground. She makes obnoxious and nasty comments all the
time. My
favorite Angelica-isms are when a baby fails a challenge and is sent back down
to the ground:
"Watch out for falling babies!" and "See you next fall!"

The characters you can choose to play with are TOMMY, CHUCKIE, PHIL, LIL, and
KIMI. My
favorite of all is LIL. She has the smartest mouth of all of them and makes me
laugh,
especially in the Cheesy Chase challenge in Moon World. Each character has his
or her
comments on what is going on.

SUSIE is the voice you hear telling you what you need to know before you begin
each game
challenge. If you miss or forget what Susie said press the start button and
then select Susie’s
Rules.  She will repeat the whole set of directions for the challenge you are
in. You will find
small batteries in each game challenge area and these are needed to open
further challenges.

You must win two or three game challenges in each world on each tier of the
play set. Winning
a game challenge gives you a big battery to put into the battery array in the
central area of
each tier. When the battery array is full the next tier of the play set deploys
and becomes
available. When you have filled the battery arrays on the three lower tiers you
will be able to
go up and challenge Angelica. As soon as Tier 3 deploys go down to the ATM on
Tier 1 and
purchase Hidden Funny Money.

Don't worry about getting all the Reptar Funny Money the first time through the
game
challenges. Just win them. After you purchase Hidden Funny Money you can go
back later and
get the all the money and any small batteries you may have missed.

If, after re-entering a challenge, you need a band-aid and can't get to one or
if you are being
heavily attacked by enemies, press Start and then select 'Yes' to QUIT LEVEL?
Susie will say
"Surrender challenge." You can then re-enter the game challenge with full
health and finish
getting the money.

You begin the game with 500 gold coins (tokens). You pay 100 coins to get up on
the play set.
If you should fail a challenge, or quit it before winning it, your baby will be
sent back down to
the back yard and you will have to pay 100 gold coins to get back up on the
play set.
Therefore you should collect all the gold coins you see in the game challenges.

You can save your game before you enter a game challenge so that, if you fail,
you can quit
the game and then start over with the same amount of gold coins.  If you run
out of gold coins
needed to get back up on the play set the game will be over. Save your game
every time you
win a game challenge just as a matter of course.  You must be in the area
outside the game
challenges to save your game.  If at first the save option does not come up,
move to another
spot until it does.

2. DIFFICULTY LEVELS

There are three difficulty levels:  Baby Easy, Rugrat Medium and Reptar Tough.
I am an adult
and have difficulty with Rugrat Medium, let alone Reptar Tough. I am sure these
levels are not
for younger children. Experienced gamers should have a good time with them.

Differences in the difficulty levels are that on the medium and tough levels
there are
Angelicas-in-a-Box all over the place and they will explode if you touch them,
there are fewer
band-aids available and fewer gold coins to collect should you need them to get
back up on
the play set. There are also many more enemies to harass you and they are
harder to destroy.
It also takes more big batteries to fill the battery arrays. On a cheerier
note, there is more
Funny Money in the harder levels of play.

3. GAMECUBE CONTROLS

A button - walk; move the boat;  move underwater; move the moon buggy; jump,
press twice
in a row to double jump

Save, Susie’s Rules, Options" menu. While this menu is displayed the game is
paused.

5. WALKTHROUGH

*ON THE GROUND*

You must choose which baby you will use to play the game. They are lined up to
the right of
the house. Press B to activate your choice. Each one will move a little to show
that it is
activated. Just keep pressing B until you get to the baby you want to use. You
can change
babies when you are outside the challenges at any time.  If the baby you want
to use is still in
the backyard you will have to pay 100 coins to get him/her up to the play set.
The baby you
were using will still be on the play set in the place where you pressed the B
button.

Go into the house and collect the gold coins in the two rooms. These coins and
those in the
back yard will reappear every time you go back down to the back yard. Walk
around the
perimeter of the yard and gather the gold coins. Then do a double jump to get
the coin by the
"Hover-vator." Step onto the Hover-vator and you will be prompted to pay 100
gold coins to
purchase an 'up' to the first floor of the play set. Click on "yes."

*TIER 1*

SNOW WORLD

Ready, Set, SNOW
Small Batteries Available: 3

In this game challenge you must race your sled against two snowmen, Chilly and
Slush. Avoid
the ice crags and snow patches, and jump the logs with A. Try not to hit
anything because it
slows you down.  First you race the small snowman, then the large snowman, then
both for a
total of three races. You must win all three races.

On the harder levels of difficulty you must find shortcuts over the banks to
have any chance at
all of winning a race.  When you re-enter the game challenge to try to get the
Funny Money
and batteries, keep an eye on the race graph at the bottom of the screen and
exit the
challenge before the snowman gets to the finish line or your baby will be sent
back down to
the back yard.

* * *

Mr. Snowtato Head
Small Batteries Available: 3

Find all of Noodle the Snowman's missing parts by following the white helper
balls next to
signs with pictures of his parts. Just touch a helper ball to get it to deploy.
Then follow it and
touch it again if you need to. You must jump up onto a roof to get his scarf.
Use the two
barrels at the side of the house to jump up to the roof. On the more difficult
levels there are
Angelicas-in-a-Box all over and you may find it tricky to maneuver around them
since you
have nothing to shoot at them and set them off. On Reptar Tough difficulty
there are no white
helper balls.

There are no enemies to bother you and Funny Money is lying around everywhere.
Explore to
find it. Take the sky-ride up the mountain to see where the money is.  Then you
can run down
the mountain and get it. There is a side path down the mountain through a fence
near the top
of the sky-ride.  You must jump down from ledge to ledge.  One of the small
batteries is on
the first ledge.  There is a tunnel to the right of the house. At the end of
the tunnel there is a
rope you can climb and at its top you will find yourself halfway up the
mountain. After you
have purchased Hidden Funny Money, go back to this game challenge and find more
Funny
Money.

* * *

Snowplace To Hide
Small Batteries Available: 3

You must get the key to unlock the mountain passages. Take the sky-ride to the
top of the
mountain to find it. Use B to throw snowballs at the taunting snowmen to smack
them and get
gold coins. You can also throw snowballs at the ice cubes to get gold coins.

Explore the area to find all the Funny Money. There is a tunnel to the right of
the house (but
no rope up to the mountain) that is blocked by ice cubes that has Funny Money
and a band-
aid in it.  After you have purchased Hidden Funny Money go back to this
challenge and find
more Funny Money.

The more difficult levels are infested with Angelicas-in-a Box and there are
many more
snowmen throwing snowballs at you. The snowmen move around much more also.

JUNGLE WORLD

River Fun Run
Small Batteries Available: 2

You must race in three boat races against three alligators: Junior, Mama and
Big Daddy. Try
not to hit anything because it slows you down and reduces your health.  You
will hear a beep-
beep as the alligator passes you. Use the Control stick to go forward and to
direct your boat.
Press X to reverse. Press A to jump. White boxes in the water are First Aid
kits.

If you are playing on one of the more difficult levels you absolutely must use
the ramps you
see as shortcuts because the alligators are much, much faster. There will also
be Angelicas-in-
a-Box in the water along with First Aid boxes if you lose health from running
into things. In
Race Two I think that Mama Alligator can somehow get a head start on you. If
this happens
you cannot catch her. The alligators are so fast on Reptar Tough level that
when they pass you
a steam train whistle sounds!

When you return to the game challenge to find Funny Money and batteries keep an
eye on the
race graph at the bottom of the screen. Exit the challenge before the alligator
gets to the
finish line or your baby will be sent back down to the back yard.

Punting Papayas
Small Batteries Available: 3

This challenge made me wonder if this game was really for little children at
all.

You must take a papaya from the base of the papaya tree and bring it to a
papaya crate. Just
walk into the papaya.  Follow the white helper ball to the crate. Walk into the
open crate with
the papaya. There are also plain tan crates here and there and these are full
of coins.  When
you are not holding a papaya use your Diapy Bounce to break them open.

You cannot double jump when you are holding a papaya.

On Baby Easy level you must crate 3 papayas.  On Rugrat Medium level you must
crate 4
papayas and on Reptar Tough level you must crate 5 papayas.

The paths are very tricky with many jumps and pitfalls. For example on Baby
Easy difficulty:
The first path has you jumping four water lily pads to a shore (edge down into
the water
before you make the first jump). You turn around on the shore and then jump
onto more
water lily pads leading to a stone pillar lying on its side.  You jump up onto
the pillar, walk
along it and then jump up to a stone portico. Your path winds around on the
portico and from
there you must navigate the tops of stone pillars. Some pillars will lean if
you stay on them
too long, these are a muddier gray color, so stand on the edge in the direction
you need to
jump) Follow the pillars down to another shore, the papaya crate and a new
papaya tree. You
will probably fall in the water a lot and drop many papayas before you get the
hang of it.

Some paths have you jumping across partially submerged pink hippopotami that
sink if you
stay on them too long. The big jumps are on big pink mushrooms.  Hold A and
bounce really
high.

If you fall in the water you lose little or no health but landing on the ground
will damage you:
the longer the fall, the greater the damage.

This game challenge is loaded with Funny Money and there is quite a bit inside
the temple
near where you begin. To get to the inside top of the temple you must travel
all the way
through the challenge to the river section. You then must jump up into the
treetops (use a
pink mushroom) to get to the temple roof. The stone projections on the temple
have money
on them but will tilt down and you will slide off unless you jump along them
quickly. Jump
inside the temple and fall down on a line of Funny Money and gold coins. You
will find yourself
back at the beginning of the challenge area.

Each difficulty level increases the number of papayas you must crate. On the
more difficult
levels of play you will pass 'check-point' trees on your way to the crate.
They will sparkle to
show they are activated. Susie will call out "check-point" when you pass one.
These trees will
give you a papaya if you accidentally drop the one you are carrying.  That way
you do not
have to go all the way back to the first tree of that particular path.

On Reptar Tough difficulty level, on the last papaya path, I do not follow the
helper ball over
the hippopotami and lily pads to the stone ‘bridge’ in the middle of the river.
When I arrive at
the river I turn right and stay on the river bank and run up the slope to go
into the cave
behind the waterfalls.  It saves a lot of trouble to do that. When you exit the
cave, follow the
path to the tree with the pink mushroom under it and jump up into the treetops.
If, after you
get to the very last check-point tree, you should fall and not lose your
papaya, you will be put
back at the pink mushroom where you jumped up into the trees. You can jump into
the water
with your papaya and you will be returned to that last tree closest to the
temple. This is the
most difficult papaya to crate because you must land on the pink mushrooms as
you bounce
from islet to islet.  If you land on the grass you will lose health. Then you
jump to the tilting
stone projections on the temple. Stay close to the temple wall and you can make
it across the
projections to the crate.

You must be very careful of your health on the difficult levels because
band-aids are few and
far between.

Monkey Business
Small Batteries Available: 3

You need to catch the monkeys that are stealing the bananas. Use the B button
to throw
bananas to stun monkeys and put them into monkey cages. It is basically the
same area as
the Punting Papayas game challenge with minor differences. Here you are
starting in the
middle of Jungle World.  On the Baby Easy level you must get four monkeys into
cages, on
Rugrat Medium you must get eight monkeys and on Reptar Tough you must get twelve
monkeys.

Don’t throw bananas around indiscriminately on the harder levels of play
because on Reptar
Tough level there are no crates of bananas to be found. However, the few single
bananas you
pick up as you make your way through the challenge area do reappear after a
while. You
cannot double jump when you are holding a monkey.

If you make a misstep bringing a monkey to a cage you will drop the monkey and
have to
catch it again. On the more difficult levels of play throw bananas at the
Angelicas-in-a-Box to
set them off instead of trying to edge by them.

On the two more difficult levels of play the rope and plank bridges have planks
missing. When
you start to cross the second bridge the viewpoint is often not good enough for
you to see the
holes in the planks.  If you run back up to the big tree trunk at the beginning
of this bridge
then when beginning your transit, the view will be adjusted so you can clearly
see the floor of
the bridge and can avoid the gaps in the planking.

First, Diapy Bounce on all the crates in the immediate area to get bananas
(Baby Easy level)
and gold coins. Otherwise the monkeys use these to dodge behind and avoid you,
and you find
yourself running in circles. Many monkeys you can chase and catch but most of
them you
must throw a banana at to stun them.  When I played this on Reptar Tough I
rarely had to
bean a monkey but maybe that was because I had improved my chase skills.

Once you have picked up the monkey by walking into it, carry it to a monkey
cage and walk
into the cage to drop it in.  You can climb up to the temple here by going
through the trees
but the stone projections here are solid and do not tilt. You cannot jump down
inside the
temple in this challenge. You can jump down a series of pillars to the base of
the temple and
finish the rest of Jungle World.

On Reptar Tough difficulty the first rope and plank bridge is blocked off by
Angelicas-in-a-
Box. After you detonate these with bananas you will find the climb up to the
second bridge
also littered with Angelicas-in-a-Box.

On both harder levels I avoid more of them on the way up to the third bridge
this way: Jump
across the second bridge until you are next to the ledge with the pink mushroom
on it. Instead
of going around this stone pile and jumping up from ledge to ledge, jump to the
left over the
bridge railing onto the mushroom and bounce up to the top of the stone pile.
You will have
avoided one large and one small box. The small one is virtually impossible to
get by without
touching it so you will have saved yourself a lot of health by taking the
shortcut. You can also
use this shortcut in the Punting Papayas challenge.

When you have nine monkeys in cages you must climb up to the temple top and
then down to
its base to finish with the last three monkeys.  The last cages are (10) and
(11) up on stone
'bridges' reached by pillars and (12) at the end of the rolling rocks canyon.

This challenge is also loaded with Funny Money. Be sure to get the Funny Money
over the
stone entrance door to the bridge area. You will have to jump down to it from
the cliff above.
Also on the cliff above is a stone gazebo of sorts. In order to get the red
Funny Money on a
wall near the edge of the cliff, you must climb up the wall behind the stone
gazebo and then
jump to the gazebo roof edge. Make your way around to the front and then jump
down onto
the red money. Whenever you have a clear view of a large area try to look all
around you to
see where the Funny Money is waiting.

UNDERSEA WORLD

Stand under the Wind Pipe and press A to be pulled up into Undersea World.  How
did Stu
Pickles manage to put islands and a sea in the play set? His water bill must be
horrendous.

Sub a Dub Dub
Small Batteries Available: 3

This game challenge requires a lot of exploration if you are to find all of the
money and
batteries. Completing the main mission is simple: Find four treasure chests and
drop them into
the big nets. The green dots on the radar highlight the treasure chests. Find a
chest and lower
the submarine down to it. When you have a treasure chest on your sub's magnet,
take it to
the giant net. You need only lower the sub over the net and the treasure chest
will
automatically drop onto it. Press A to go forward, press X to reverse and use
the Control stick
to go up or down.

Watch out for the giant electric eels. They are a silvery blue and have arcs of
electricity
sparking about them.  Use the B button to fire a "torspeedo" at them. It takes
three hits to
dispatch them. If they get near you they will shock you until your health is
gone so shoot from
a distance. There are also annoying yellow fish that will blow up when you get
near them. If
you get too near they will explode and you will loose health. Unfortunately
your torspeedoes
are of no use against them. There are many more of these two enemies on the
harder levels
of difficulty. If your submarine bumps into anything you will lose health.
There are band-aids
floating in bubbles and there is one in the middle of the first net you see in
case you need it.

On Reptar Tough level of difficulty there are lots of giant electric eels and
yellow blow fish.
You must still find four treasure chests. The sunken boats seem to have
multiplied and
sprouted extra masts and spars so that there is a veritable obstacle course for
you to
navigate.  Of course the electric eels and yellow blowfish all hang around
where there is a
treasure chest. If you are not careful you will sustain a lot of damage to your
sub from the
boat rigging and from those yellow fish.  Torspeedo the electric eels and find
the chest. When
you have a treasure chest, rise almost to the surface and speed to the net.
That way the
yellow fish don’t have time to blow up because you are already past them.

Coins in this game challenge can be hidden under piles of black rocks. Use the
B button to
blow up the rocks. Other large black rocks can also be blown up to reveal coins
or a tunnel
opening. Although there is a lot of money in this area, especially after you
purchase Hidden
Funny Money, it is very difficult to see. You have to be nearly on top of it
before it really
becomes visible.

Hot Cod Racer
Small Batteries Available: 2

Herman and his hermit crabs challenge you to a race. You are racing against
other hermit crab
'chariots.' Follow the red arrows to stay on course. Press A to go forward and
use the Control
stick to control your direction. You cannot reverse. You must complete three
laps and stay
ahead of the others to win. Halfway through the lap there is a short-cut where
you can go
down into a tunnel and come out ahead of the other crab chariots.

As you have no weapons, the electric eels and yellow blow fish don't go after
you in this
challenge but if you do run into an electric eel, you will be zapped. You will
not lose health but
it will slow you down. It's easy to win on Baby Easy, but very difficult on the
harder levels. On
Reptar Tough the other chariots are really fast and difficult to pass.

As in Sub A Dub Dub there is a lot of Funny Money to be found but it is
difficult to see and
find.

When you re-enter the challenge to find Funny Money and batteries you must keep
an eye on
the race graph at the bottom of the screen.  It tells you the position of all
the racers.  Since
you are taking your time to hunt for items you will be last.  Do not let a
racer reach the finish
line or your baby will be sent down to the back yard.  When a racer is almost
to the end of lap
three, exit the game challenge and then return again to finish your hunt for
items.

ARABIAN WORLD

Meanie Genie
Small Batteries Available: 4

The Nice Genie’s big brother, Meanie Genie, has escaped from his lamp.  This
game challenge
is broken up into two sections. In the first part you ride a camel and use the
B button to make
it spit at Meanie Genie’s purple scarab beetles. If you are not fast enough the
beetles will get
to you and bite you until your health is gone.  You must do this three times.
The first time the
beetles are on the ground. The second time they are flying in the air and the
third time they
are both in the air and on the ground. This is easy on the Baby Easy level but
not easy on the
harder levels because the beetles are much faster. On the easier levels there
are 50 scarab
beetles in each wave. On Reptar Tough level there are 100 beetles in each wave
and they are
super fast. The third wave is absolutely the worst.  Your health can go down so
fast that you
are tossed out of the challenge before you know it.

The second section is in the genie's cavern. After you get off the camel at the
entrance to the
cavern you can return to the challenge start on foot and collect any Funny
Money/batteries.
Then return to where you got off the camel. Once you enter the cavern avoid the
green mist.
It will knock you out. On the more difficult levels the green mist sprays out
four ways at a
time

You can quickly need a band-aid but fortunately band-aids are usually around
and they
reappear after a minute so you can go back and get more health if you need it.
Most of the
rocks you must jump across will sink into the lava if you stand on them so move
quickly. Run
up the path and you will see Meanie Genie. Avoid the rocks Meanie Genie throws
at you and
touch his lamp. Then he will go back in the lamp for a "time-out."

When you re-enter this challenge to get all the Funny Money go past the genie
and you will
find yourself climbing spiral paths that end in nothing and will have to jump
onto flying carpets
to continue your hunt.

Warning: On Baby Easy difficulty do not go over to the place where a cliff
looks like a face.
That is where the lamp is on the Rugrat Medium level. If you do, you will not
be able to exit
this area and will have to surrender the challenge and begin your hunt for
Funny Money and
batteries again. This means facing the nasty bugs again.

* * *

Rugrat Rug Race
Small Batteries Available: 3

You are riding a flying carpet and must collect 100 of the jewels that you see
as you fly three
laps around the course. Use the Control stick to direct the carpet left, right,
up and down.
Press A to jump your carpet up to reach items just above you and to get to
higher places or
paths. You cannot reverse.

If you get all the jewels required in less than three laps, the game challenge
will end with a
win anyway. There is no time limit so you can try to snatch the Funny Money and
batteries as
you fly by (but concentrate on the jewels). If you don't get it all the first
time you can return
to the challenge later and pick it up. Just remember to exit the challenge
before the third lap
is over so your baby is not sent back down to the back yard.

On the more difficult levels of play there are fewer jewels but a lot more
money.  I am not
very good at this on the harder levels so I find that, if I bang the carpet
into a wall many
times (A button) in the different areas, jewels will often just fly into me and
increase my count
that way.  You must be a champion rug driver on Reptar Tough to win this one.

* * *

Temple of the Lamp
Small Batteries Available: 3

The Nice Genie has locked himself out of his house. His lamp is in the Temple.
You must
collect a certain number of jewels, depending on the difficulty level, to open
the gates to the
Temple. Baby Easy requires 40 jewels, Rugrat Medium requires 55 jewels and
Reptar Tough
requires 70 jewels. Gems are all over the place, on the ground, in jars, on
roofs, by stone
piles. To open the jars use the Diapy Bounce. The jars can contain coins,
jewels... or purple
scarab beetles! Ouch! The jars up on the roofs are all safe to open.

There are blue trampolines to help you jump up to roofs. Most of the buildings
have awnings
on the doors and windows so you can use them to jump from one awning to another
or to
different buildings or tall rock piles. Just hold down the A button to jump
very high. There are
also magic ropes that will extend up from a coil to help you reach a building
roof or a floating
jewel. There are several flying carpets about in the second area and if you
stand in the right
place you can jump on them to hitch a ride to higher places.

If you fall in the river you can get out on a path up to the first area.  There
are coins and
Funny Money in the river but the money is underwater and really hard to get.
Jump from the
highest point on the bridge and make sure you land right on top of it.

In the two harder challenges there are large purple scarab beetles that will
attack you. Avoid
them if you can. If they bite you, you will lose health. You can hear them
coming. Get on
something a level above them (a blue trampoline is not high enough and a jar is
not safe
enough) and watch them run into the wall and explode.

After you have gathered the required number of gems the gates to the Temple
will open and
you can get the Genie's lamp. All the jars here are full of gold coins. Be sure
to go around the
outside and collect all the money and gold coins before you enter. There are
money and coins
floating in the water so look for them.

Funny Money may be suspended in the air, especially in front of tall rock
piles, requiring you
to jump from one place to another or to fall on it to collect it.

CIRCUS WORLD

Cone Caper
Small Batteries Available: 4

You must navigate a circus side show to get to the end of the game challenge.
There are
clowns everywhere throwing pink snow cones at you. "Har-de-har-har-har!" Smack
them with
your pink snow cones (B button) to knock them down and get gold coins. Diapy
Bounce on the
big blue crates to get more cones. You can carry up to ninety-nine cones at a
time. The crates
reappear after a time so you can return to them if you are in the same area.
There are lots of
band-aids in case you need them.

The fountain in the rear of the side show area has lots of money on it. There
are two semi-
hidden areas where you can get money also: the airplane ride and the Ferris
wheel. If you see
an alley bounded by wooden fences, investigate it.

Follow the white helper ball to the final area. There is a large trampoline.
Hold down the A
button to jump farther and higher. This area is full of stacked crates and
boxes. Climb up the
tallest pile of crates to get a small battery.  From up there you can see where
everything is.

Jump into the rocket gun to be shot into the fenced enclosure where you will
have to beat a
"boss." There are three rounds to this. Each time hit the three clowns with
cones and then hit
a target on the big revolving clown head. Each time there is one less target to
hit, ending with
one only on round three. If you don’t hit the target fast enough in any round,
the clown head
will lower and you will have to repeat that round.

On Baby Easy the clown head just revolves. On Rugrat Medium, the revolving
clown head will
shoot out cotton candy vapor at you along with pink snow cones. On Reptar Tough
the
revolving clown head shoots pink snow cones in round one.  If you stand in line
with a small
clown, the clown head will shoot him as it tries to get to you!  In round two
it shoots pink
snow cones and pink cotton candy vapor.  In round three it shoots pink snow
cones, pink
cotton candy vapor and cotton candy bombs.

Acrobatty Dash
Small Batteries Available: 3

This game challenge is timed so do not stop to get the Funny Money or the
batteries the first
time in. Just win the challenge and return to collect these items. Baby Easy
level gives you 7
minutes to start. Rugrat Medium gives you 3 minutes 30 seconds and Reptar Tough
gives you
only 2 minutes to finish. However, every time you touch the white helper ball
you have
seconds added to the time remaining. If you don’t fall off anything you can end
the challenge
with the same time left as when you began.

Make your way from one end of the tent to the other. Jump into the rocket guns
to be shot
across the tent after the helper ball. DO NOT LOSE YOUR WHITE HELPER BALL or
the STAR on
the last platform will not appear. Touch the star to finish. You must touch the
helper ball every
time you come up to it. If you do get ahead of it and fall down to the floor
the game will put
you back to where the helper ball is. Hold the A button to bounce higher on the
big drums and
make it to the next one. If you fall you will lose health and time.  You must
also swing on
trapezes and hang-ride down zip lines. If you time it right you can jump from
trapeze to
trapeze and save time.

When returning to the challenge watch the time clock and surrender the
challenge before it
runs out or your baby will be sent back down to the back yard.

Cream Pie Flyer
Small Batteries Available: 4

You are flying a plane in the Big Top circus tent. To win the game challenge
shoot cream pies
at the trucks circling below and then at the clowns that fall out. If you keep
shooting pies at
the empty trucks you can destroy them, and the clowns will be left to run
around on the floor.
The trucks shoot cotton candy bombs.  On Reptar Tough level the trucks’ aim is
improved so
you can lose health quickly if you don’t keep your distance.

A number on each side of a truck indicates how many clowns are inside so you
will know how
many there are left that you must hit. More cream pies are available at the top
of the tent,
attached to balloons. There is a lot of Funny Money up there and on the ground.
The red and
white boxes are First Aid kits and will restore you to full health if your
plane has bumped into
anything or you are hit by any cones or bombs.

On the more difficult levels there are clowns on the top rafters who throw snow
cones at you
so it is harder to get the refills you need from the balloons. There are only
four First Aid kits
on Reptar Tough and they do not reappear.  Your strategy here is to eliminate
the clowns on
the rafters first so that you can get to the refill balloons when you need
them.  Do not use a
First Aid kit until your health is almost gone since a First Aid kit restores
you to full health.

There is red Funny Money near the top of the center tent pole and over the red
banners at
either end of the tent. There is purple Funny Money on a rafter and hiding
behind the red
banners also.  Blue Funny Money is all over the floor.

DINO WORLD
As Lil says, "This is funner than dirt!" Now Stu Pickles has managed to squeeze
an entire
prehistoric world, including volcanoes, onto the play set. How does he heat up
the lava?

Rex Riding
Small Batteries Available: 4

This is the easiest game challenge in the entire game. You must collect bones
and drop them
on the bone pile. Sneak up on the dinosaurs slowly and from behind because if
one sees you it
runs away. Walk into it and you will then be riding it. Run over the bones to
pick them up.
Run over the bone pile to drop the bone.  A "ding" will sound indicating your
success. You can
also press B to throw the bones on the pile but I find it is much easier just
to run over it. On
Baby Easy difficulty you will find enough bones in the general area right
around the bone pile.

The dinosaurs jump extremely far and high so use them to jump over the lava to
get more
bones on the harder levels of difficulty. They can easily over-jump a target so
you will learn by
doing when and where to jump them. They also cannot make tight turns because
they run so
fast.  They do not stop. If you want to get off you will have to run the
dinosaur into
something.

There are three main areas in this challenge. The first is where the challenge
begins, a large
grassy field.  The second area is a volcanic island in the lake and the third
is across the lake
where there is a giant rib cage lying on the ground.  Actually this third area
is on the other
side of the big volcano from the first area. When you go through the tunnel
path looking for
bones or money, etc. you will see it below.

It is much easier to find all the small batteries and Funny Money on foot. Your
baby can make
the jumps that the dinosaurs do to get to islands in the lava. Some of the
money is on the
edge of an island and the dinosaurs cannot get to it without falling in the
lava. Look for places
where you can climb up higher.

Be sure to look for rocks hidden in the lava smoke where red money is waiting.
There are two
of these places: One is in the volcano on the island in the lake and there is
also red money on
a ledge behind this volcano. The other smoke hidden rock is on the upper slope
of the main
volcano, above the large grassy field.  Follow giant rock "steps" up to this
one.

If your dinosaur runs into a wall or falls into the lava you will be set down
on land closest to
where it fell. If it falls in the shallow lake you will be left in the lake.
The dinosaur will be
returned to where you found it.

Fly High Egg Hunt
Small Batteries Available: 4

Follow the white helper balls to the colored eggs and to a "scary-dactyl" that
will fly you up to
the nest where the egg belongs. Walk into it to get on its back. The nests are
in the tops of
tall trees and already have a colored egg in them so you can tell into which
nest to drop the
egg. You do this by flying closely over the nest. Do not let the scary-dactyl
bump into anything
because you will lose health rapidly. Green creatures scuttle between the rocks
on the ground
and if one hits you while you are walking you can lose health. There are
band-aids on the
ground, in the tops of trees and on top of tall rocks for you to collect if you
need them.

Baby Easy level is just that, but at the harder levels of difficulty this
challenge is really very
hard to win. The paths you must take to get to the eggs and the scary-dactyls
are peppered
with Angelicas-in-a-Box or are down in the lava.

There is Funny Money all over the area and down just above the surface of the
lava lake. If
you look at the lava lake from the sky, it resembles a large dinosaur
footprint. Look in the top
of the volcano and fly through the mountain tunnel for some large amounts of
Funny Money.
Unfortunately you cannot go on foot all around this challenge area because the
lake is lava,
not water as in Rex Riding, and is a barrier between the areas. Therefore you
must use a
scary-dactyl to collect most of the items. You must have an egg for the
scary-dactyl to carry
you.

MOON WORLD

Stand under the Wind Pipe and Press A to be pulled up to Moon World. Jumping is
easy "on
the moon" because you weigh less and can float to higher levels than usual.  I
wonder how
Stu Pickles managed this?

Rise of the Anjellyuns
Small Batteries Available: 5

Your spaceship has crashed on the moon and needs to be repaired. Follow the
helper balls
around the cheese factory to easily find the engine parts. Press B to throw
your glow bombs to
blow up the Anjellyuns. Watch out for the "moon booms" they toss at you! If you
fall from a
platform while over the 'abyss,' you will be returned to the edge where you
started.

This challenge is much, much harder on the difficult levels of play. There are
mega-giant
Anjellyuns and teeny, tiny Anjellyuns and they are all out to get you. However,
just one of
your glow bombs can take out a group of the teeny, tiny ones at one blow. The
little ones will
also follow you to run into the crates you stand on and into the edge of the
Cheese Factory
platform. They make a satisfying splat. Thank goodness the band-aids reappear
after a short
time. Be sure to check out both sides of the first upper airlock (above the
room with the
plants). There should be $500 there. Just get rid of that mega-giant Anjellyun
first. The
challenge area is large and you must explore it to find all the Funny Money and
batteries.

* * *

Moon Buggy Madness
Small Batteries Available: 4

You must collect fifty pieces of cheese to win this game challenge. Your fuel
runs out quickly
so you must run into the fuel cells that you see floating about the area to
refill your tank. After
you have won the challenge, return to collect the money and batteries.

There is Funny Money all over the challenge area but the overhead tracks seem
to have most
of it.  The problem is staying on the track as you zoom around trying to pick
up the money.
You also need to be up on these tracks to jump down onto some of the bigger
piles of money
on the main floor because they are on top of rock piles. To get up onto the
Radio Telescope
you can back off to a distance and use one of the small hills as a ramp along
with jumping (B
button).

At the harder levels the fuel cells are fewer and do not reappear after they
are used. If you
drive too fast the moon buggy will likely turn upside down. Use the B button to
jump it and try
to get right side up.

* * *

Cheesy Chase
Small Batteries Available: 4

This game challenge is easy but it takes some time to finish. You are inside
the cheese factory
and there is a big problem with mice stealing the cheese. The number of mice
you must catch
depends on your level of difficulty.

Look for a round of yellow cheese and there will probably be mice around it.
These mice are
fairly easy to catch with your vacuum (press and hold the B button) but most of
them do have
little jet packs to help them fly away. Catch five to fill your vacuum then go
to a "Mouse
House" and shoot them in with the B button.

There are many areas to explore in this challenge and you will need to go to
all of them in the
more difficult levels of play. On the higher floors (through the upper
air-locks) of the Baby
Easy level and everywhere on the harder levels, besides the awful and
irritating Angelicas-in-
a-Box, there are round green bombs lying everywhere. They click when you get
near, arming
themselves. If you actually touch one it will blow up, costing you health. Look
down before
you jump down between crates or cases to make sure you don't land on a bomb
unexpectedly.

* * *

MEDIEVAL WORLD

Holy Pail
Small Batteries Available: 4

YOU MUST NOT LOSE THE WHITE HELPER BALL because it alone can lead you to the
Holy Pail
(along the Holy Pail Trail). You cannot find it by yourself. The Holy Pail will
not appear, even if
you know where it is found.

There are pink potion bottles to take that will enable you to shoot back at the
magical hollow
armors that shoot at you. Press the B button to shoot. It takes two hits to
destroy a magical
armor. A knocking sound will warn you when one is nearby. There are also
shields to protect
you from the magical armor's green missiles. These items are temporary and when
the colors
dull at the bottom of the screen you must go and get another potion and shield.
Green boots
are found where you must make a long or tall jump. The power of the boots is
very short-lived
so you need to know what or where to jump at or to quickly. You sometimes need
the boots to
jump up to the white helper ball.

At the more difficult levels of play it is better to eliminate all the magical
armors first before
you try to get anywhere. Some areas are absolutely infested with them but they
can be
destroyed with patience on your part. On these levels the helper ball will
actually dive into the
river and you must jump off the highest point of a bridge directly onto it to
deploy it to the
next stop. So, if all of a sudden you lose sight of the helper ball, look in
the river first before
wandering all over Medieval World trying to find it again.

There are also two magical places up on the bluffs each with a central teleport
that will send
you to the opposite side of Medieval World.  One is full of band-aids.

* * *

Let's Play Bow and Apples
Small Batteries Available: 4

As Susie says, "You finally get to play with food!" Shoot the barrels, or
targets to open a tower
or the castle, and get the amount of apples required. Press B to take out your
bow and arrow.
Press X to put it away. You can't run quickly with it out. Press B and hold it
to shoot farther.
Use the Control stick to aim up or down, left or right. You never run out of
ammunition.

There are magical hollow armors that will attack you but you can eliminate them
by shooting
them. They give four apples in the Baby Easy level, less in the harder levels.
There are not
many band-aids available on the more difficult levels of play so be very
careful when you hear
the knocking sound that indicates a magical armor is nearby. There are many,
many magical
armors in the harder levels and they are all over, even up on the roofs in the
castle keep. The
magical armors, together with the Angelicas-in-the Box sitting on places you
need to be, will
give you a lot of shooting to do.

Funny Money is in odd places in Medieval World, on the roofs of the houses in
the castle keep
for instance. In the keep there are platforms here and there to help you get
up.  If you are
playing on the easiest level you can also jump onto a barrel to the left of the
church and then
up to a walkway. Just don't shoot the barrel first! Look behind the houses
also. Money can
sometimes be found floating in the water. You can wander all over the challenge
area and not
find any money and then you may find $250 just sitting in the middle of an
intersection of
paths. Climb up to each of the windmills and see what is there. It takes a lot
of searching to
find it all.

*THE TOWER*

STORMIN' THE CASTLE

You are driving your very own kittypult. Press B to pull back the scoop and lob
a rock. Watch
the strength meter as you hold down B. The higher it is, the farther your rock
will go. Lob
rocks at everything you see. You will be surprised at what you can break up.
Sometimes there
are things you need under structures or haystacks. If you find yourself and
your kittypult
upside down press B to flip yourself over by using the catapult as a lever.
Press X to reverse.

Angelica will try to hit you with big bubbles.  If one touches you your health
will go down. Find
a band-aid to restore your health. Even though Angelica is obnoxious with her
remarks you
cannot hit her with a rock.

There are colored shields on the ground areas and on overhead tracks. These you
must roll
onto. They will lift the grates over the door to the next area so you can pelt
it with your rocks.

In the last area drive onto the green path that meanders through all the areas,
go to the end
and lob a rock at the barred window. Drive through the opening at high speed
and get a key,
money and a First Aid kit as you fall. You will land in the first castle area
you opened.

Return to the final area and go up the ramp. The door to a secret room is now
open. This
room is carpeted with gold coins and full of overhead ramps hanging from the
ceiling. The
ramps are difficult to get up to and to stay on but they are full of lots and
lots of money. Take
your kittypult to a high corner of the room closest to the ramp access and race
down to it to
get up to the ramps.  It may take you many tries but you can do it. You may
also fall off many
times but if you want to buy all the bonus games you will need that Funny Money
lying about
up there.

Once you open the door to Angelica, you have beaten the game. Save your game.

On the harder levels of play there are Angelicas-in-the Box scattered around
and magical
hollow armors will attack you.  Fortunately you have an unlimited supply of
rocks.

6. SINGLE/MULTIPLAYER BONUS GAMES*

pulled up to where you can buy the games with Funny Money. All the original

sounds hilarious, especially the toilet flushes. This is not available until
Tier 3 is deployed.

7. GLITCHES

1. The first glitch I found in this game is that when you are jumping from
place to place you
can inadvertently end up ‘inside’ a rock or a structure, or in a niche or
crevasse. Sometimes
you can get out by repeatedly pressing A and using the Control Stick, but you
may have to
exit the challenge.

If you do not manage to get out of your rock or structure, etc. the game will
often put you
back at the beginning of the challenge. This has happened to me in challenges
and I would
just return to where I was before. However, in Fly High Egg Hunt I already had
six of the
seven eggs gathered. I had to exit this challenge because there is no way to
get to the second
area on foot and I had gathered all the eggs in the first area. You cannot use
a scarey-dactyl
unless you have an egg and there were none.

*However, igorseabra@gmail.com wrote me to say: I have found that it is
possible to get from
the first area to the second on foot…To do it, you must have full health. From
the start, go
back and left until you get to the lava lake, near the wall. From here, jump as
far as you can
and then keep jumping on the lava until you're at the other side.  I've tested
by myself and it
works, trust me.*

2. The second glitch is in the Temple of the Lamp challenge. On the more
difficult levels of
play Susie continues to tell you that you need to collect 40 jewels to open the
gates to the
Temple. In fact, on Rugrat Medium you need 55 jewels and on Reptar Tough you
need 70
jewels. The number showing on the bottom of the screen is correct, however.

3. When I was playing in Medieval World, there was purple Funny Money over the
castle gate.
You could see it from both sides of the gate but it is impossible to get
anything there because
the game does not allow you to jump there.

8. CHEATS

I have found no cheat codes whatsoever for this game.  If they exist, please
send them to me
at cathairetic@cox.net  and I will be happy to give you credit.

INTRODUCTION
------------

[from the game manual]

Chuckie and the babies are in luck!  Tommy's dad, Stu, is going to do some
work at an amusement park called EuroReptarland in Paris, France!  Tommy
gets to take some of his friends along for the trip.  While Stu is
working, the kids get to take a special tour of the amusement park.  They
meet Kimi, whose mom works at the park.  Kimi's an expert on the layout of
the park, and is going to give the babies a guided tour.

EuroReptarland is run by Coco LeBouche, who isn't as nice as someone who
works in an amusement park should be.  Coco doesn't watch where she's
going and trips over Chuckie's favorite toy, his teddy bear named Wawa.
She grabs Wawa and gives it to her assistant to get rid of!  The assistant
takes off into the park with Wawa!

The babies promise to help Chuckie get Wawa back.  Thank goodness Kimi is
along, ready to help navigate the huge amusement park!

GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS
-----------------

[all text from the game manual, rearranged by me for better reading]

Saving Games
Your games are automatically saved when you exit the game.  You can go
back to your saved game and you'll still have all of your inventory items
and will be in the same place in the adventure.  All of the entrances
you've opened will still be unlocked.  Just continue your quest for Wawa.

Navigating
Use your mouse to move around (or the arrow keys on your keyboard).  Move
the shoeprints cursor where you want the babies to go, then left-click.
The babies will walk to where you clicked.  Use your mouse to left-click
on items in the game.  Your cursor will change to an exclamation point (!)
whenever it is positioned over a clickpoint.  If you see an exclamation
point (!), click on that spot.

Monitor Consoles
There's some secret information you need to learn if you're going to win
the game.  Fortunately (or not), Angelica has made her way into the
control room!  Go to the monitor consoles you'll see around the park to
talk to Angelica.  She won't give out important information unless you
give her chocolate candy bonbons.  You can collect the bonbons as you
travel through EuroReptarland.  Collect all the candies you can, because
Angelica can see everything from the control room and has lots of advice
to give.

Games
When Chuckie and the babies find a game they need to play in order to get
Chuckie's Wawa, the mouse cursor will change into a ticket.  Click to
play.


On-Screen Display
-----------------

Inventory Items
The items in your inventory will appear in your backpack until you use
them.  Pick up items you see along the way, like bonbons or light sticks.
The bonbons will be needed to buy information from Angelica, who's in the
park's control room.  The light sticks are needed to see in the darkness
of the underground park.

Help & Hints
Click on the Question Mark to get help and hints.  When you click the Help
Button, Kimi will offer tips and tricks for the section of the game you're
in.  If Kimi has more than one tip for you, click the Arrow Button to get
another tip.  Click OK when you're done.

Back Arrow
Click the Back Arrow to go back to the beginning or exit the game.

Difficulty Level
Click on the Difficulty Icon to change the level of difficulty of the game
you're currently playing.  If you're in the middle of a game and it's too
hard, change the difficulty level to an easier setting and you'll restart
that game with the new difficulty level.

================================================================================

WALKTHROUGH
-----------

The original walkthrough was provided to me by THQ e-mail support.  I have
added information from the game manual, as well as from my own playing, to
it.

1. To start, walk up and to the left to go into Ooey Gooey World.

2. If you win all 10 levels you will get the key that will allow you to
enter the elevator that goes to basement #1.

Ooey Gooey World
Help Kimi drive her car through ten levels of mazes.  She must collect the
elevator key hidden somewhere along the tracks and make it to the exit
before getting slimed!  As the car moves through the maze, click on the
Gooey Mice to switch to different tracks that will lead Kimi in another
direction.  Use the spacebar to give Kimi's car a surge of speed.  Kimi
will get slimed if she runs into obstacles or traps.  She can only take so
much slime before she gets "slimed out" and has to start over again.  Go
through a car wash to clean up the slime and empty the slime meter.
Direct Kimi's car to collect all the bonus items you can, like the Reptar
and Robosnail toys, to earn extra points.

3. Walk to the right from Ooey Gooey World, to get to the elevator.

4. Once in Basement #1 you will need to get the Box.  It will be found in
the lower left hand corner of basement #1.  You can get to it by
heading left from the monitor that Angelica appears on.

5. Find the top middle section of the basement and use the box to get on
the lift.

6. At the top you will be above ground and you will need to go up to get
to the Rice Bowl Ride.

7. Try to collect Bon Bons and Light Sticks along the way.

8. Help Dil collect all of his toys to beat the Rice Bowl Ride to get the
shovel.

Rice Bowl Ride
Baby Dil's stuff is lost in the Rice Bowl ride.  Grab Dil's stuff and make
it to the exit before time runs out.  Watch for the spinning rice bowls
that move around and must be avoided.  Use the directional arrows on the
keyboard to maneuver Dil.  Using two keys at one time, such as the right
arrow and down arrow, will move Dil at an angle.  Guide Dil past the bowls
to pick up his belongings.  If a rice bowl hits him, he'll drop his stuff.
Pick up bonus items, like rattles, for big points!  Watch for special
items like the ice cube and the green clock to help you out.

9. After you complete the Rice Bowl Ride, go back down to Basement #1 and
collect the Bon Bon.  You will need to go back up the lift and go up and
to the right until you see a patch of dirt by a boarded up entrance.  Move
up and click with the shovel.

10. You are then taken to Basement #2.  Try to collect all of the Bon Bons
first, then you will need to travel to the right until you see a circular
wheel with 4 colors and several gears to the right of it.  Hit the Red
lever to activate the gears.

11. Click the Blue button, then Red, then Green to deactivate the gears.
You will then be able to get through.  This order may change randomly,
it's part of the puzzle.  You will need to do this again to go back the
other way as well.

12. Once past the Gears you will see a TV to the right.  Click on it and
you will talk to Angelica and give her the Bon Bons and she will give you
a piece of paper with a code on it in exchange.

13. You will need to go back to the left and go back above ground.  Then
go back down into Basement #1.  Collect all the bon bons you can find.

14. From the Lift in Basement #1 go to the left to get to the Large
computer.  Get near the computer and the cursor will turn into a piece of
paper with numbers on it.  Click and Chuckie will enter the numbers into
the computer and you will go above ground to a new area.

15. Go up and then to the left to get to the Chuckie Chan Game.  This game
is a lot like the classic Pong (though it's more reminiscent of Breakout
on the Atari 2600 to me).  You must beat all 10 levels to win the Black
Belt for Chuckie.

Chuckie Chan
Chuckie Chan, the well-known martial arts expert, is featured in this
arcade game.  Use the left/right arrow keys or hold down the left mouse
button to move Chuckie across the screen.  Whenever the ball comes near
Chuckie, he'll punch it.  Use the spacebar to launch the ball.  Maneuver
Chuckie to hit the balls toward the wall of masks.  Don't lose the ball,
or you'll lose one chance.  Some of the masks are special bonus power-ups.
Collect all the bonus items you can like the pinwheel and the rattle to
earn extra points.  Watch for the special bonus ice cream cone, too!
Press the spacebar to have Chuckie kick the ball fast and earn more points
when you hit items.  Keep the ball in motion and hit all the masks until
Chuckie earns his black belt!

16. Go back down the ladder and click on the TV monitor.  You will then be
given a mission by Angelica to rescue her doll from the volcano.

17. Go to the right and click on the Lift to get above ground.

18. Then go back up to the right and click on the patch of dirt with the
shovel.  You will be taken down in to Basement #2.  Go to the right until
you get to the Escalator then go up.

19. Once up the escalator you will need to go downward and then up the
wooden ramp.  Click to enter the Ninja Chase (which plays a lot like
Donkey Kong).  Beat all 10 levels of the Ninja Chase to get Angelica's
Cynthia doll.

Ninja Chase
Tommy, the best climber of the group, is given the assignment of
retrieving Angelica's Cynthia doll from the top of a volcano.  He must get
there before the Ninja security guards can grab him!  Use the arrow keys
to move Tommy and use the spacebar to help him jump over obstacles.  Use
the spacebar in combination with the left and right arrow keys to do a
running jump.  If the Ninja guards catch Tommy, he'll lose one chance and
have to start over.  Grab all the bonus power-ups you can, like the bag of
marbles!  Collect bonus points by collecting flowers along the way.  At
the end of each level, a cargo lift will take Tommy higher for more
climbing.

20. Go down and to the right and down the tube to get back to Basement #1
once you have beaten the Ninja Chase game.

21. Navigate up and to the left to get back to the TV Monitor to give
Cynthia back to Angelica.  She will then turn off the security system for
you.

22. Go right, then down, and then back left, to get to the Elevator that
was in the beginning of the game.  Now go back up the elevator.  When you
are back to the beginning area, go down until you see a metal ramp.  Click
to enter the Reptar Service Entrance and play the final game - Reptar vs.
Robosnail.

Reptar vs. Robosnail
Control the star of EuroReptarland, Reptar himself, in a robotic battle
against his evil nemesis, Robosnail.  You'll be fighting on a bridge over
the river Seine in the heart of Paris.  Push Robosnail off the bridge to
win the game!  Use the arrow keys to control Reptar and the arrow keys in
combination with the spacebar to push Robosnail away.  Use the spacebar by
itself to do a defensive move to avoid a shove from Robosnail.  Don't let
Robosnail push Reptar into the river, or the game ends.  There are bonus
power-ups along the bridge that'll help both robot monsters, so watch for
the lightning bolts and batteries.

23. Assuming you've pushed Robosnail off the bridge, you have now won the
game.  Congratulations.
